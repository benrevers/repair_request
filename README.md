# repair_request

I originally wrote this gsheets code to streamline the repair/replace process at Planet Sub. Before this, 1 person was in charge of ordering parts for downed machines and replacing them when they came in causing expensive parts to pile up and stores to lose money waiting on repairs. With this sheet, anyone with access was able to submit a request for repair as well as track repair requests of mission critical devices.
